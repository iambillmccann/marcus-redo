# Structured History Sections Planning

## High-Level Steps

### 1. Parse Unstructured Text into Structured Data
- **Retrieve Corpus from Firebase Storage**:
  - Fetch the uploaded text files from Firebase Storage.
  - Combine multiple files into a single corpus if necessary.

- **Send Corpus to LLM**:
  - Use an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT or similar) to parse the corpus into structured JSON data.
  - Define a schema for the JSON output, including fields for:
    - Contact Information
    - Career Objectives
    - Skills
    - Job History
    - Education

- **Prompt Engineering**:
  - Craft prompts to guide the LLM in structuring the data accurately.
  - Include instructions for merging duplicates (e.g., duplicate job entries) and cleaning up inconsistencies (e.g., date formats).

---

### 2. Store Structured Data
- **Save JSON to Firebase Firestore**:
  - Once the LLM returns structured data, save it to Firestore for easy retrieval and updates.
  - Use Firestore collections to organize data:
    - `users/{userId}/structuredHistory/contactInfo`
    - `users/{userId}/structuredHistory/jobHistory`
    - `users/{userId}/structuredHistory/education`

### 3. Build the UX for Structured History Sections
- **Design LinkedIn-Style Profile Interface**:
  - Create a tabbed or section-based UI for:
    - Contact Information
    - Career Objectives
    - Skills
    - Job History
    - Education
  - Allow inline editing for each field.

- **Implement CRUD Operations**:
  - Enable users to edit, save, and delete entries.
  - Use Firestore to persist changes.

- **Add Validation and Feedback**:
  - Validate user inputs (e.g., email format, date ranges).
  - Provide visual feedback for unsaved changes.

---

### 4. Handle Updates and Re-Parsing
- **Re-Parse Button**:
  - Add a button to trigger re-parsing of the corpus if users upload new files or make significant edits.
  - Merge new data with existing structured data intelligently.

- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Prompt the LLM to handle conflicts (e.g., duplicate entries or overlapping dates).
  - Allow users to manually resolve conflicts via the UI.

---

### 5. Optimize LLM Integration
- **Batch Processing**:
  - If the corpus is large, split it into smaller chunks and process them sequentially or in parallel.
- **Cost Management**:
  - Use token-efficient prompts and caching to minimize LLM usage costs.

---

### 6. Deployment and Testing
- **Backend**:
  - Deploy Firebase Cloud Functions to handle LLM requests and Firestore updates.
- **Frontend**:
  - Test the UX for responsiveness and accessibility.
- **End-to-End Testing**:
  - Ensure the entire flow (upload → parse → edit → save) works seamlessly.

---

### 7. Stretch Goals
- **Reordering**:
  - Allow users to reorder items (e.g., job history, skills) via drag-and-drop.
- **Multiple Entries**:
  - Support multiple email addresses, phone numbers, etc.
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Add indicators for unsaved changes or incomplete sections.
